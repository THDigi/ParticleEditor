Usage:
1. Get the .dll from the [Releases](/releases) tab.
2. Have it be anywhere but you need to copy the path to it.
3. Open its properties and unblock it.
4. In SpaceEngineer's launch parameters, add `-plugin "path/to/the/dll"`
5. Launch the game, load any offline world and press `Shift+F` to open the editor.

Past this you will have tooltips for everything, mentioning hotkeys and such.  
There is still much to be improved so feedback and bugreports are welcome in the [Issues](/issues) tab.
