## Install:
As of SE v202 the `-plugin` launch arg no longer exists ([official statement](https://www.spaceengineersgame.com/plugins/))

You have to install [Plugin Loader](https://github.com/sepluginloader/PluginLoader) and after that the Particle Editor will be in its plugins list.


## Usage: 
Launch the game, load any offline world and press `Shift+F` to open the editor.

Past this you will have tooltips for everything, mentioning hotkeys and such.

There is still much to be improved so feedback and bugreports are welcome in the [Issues](https://github.com/THDigi/ParticleEditor/issues) tab.
