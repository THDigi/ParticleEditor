A plugin for Space Engineers game to allow modders to develop particles much easier.

## Install:
1. Get the .dll from the [Releases](https://github.com/THDigi/ParticleEditor/releases) link on the right side.
2. Have it be anywhere but you need to copy the path to it.
3. Open its properties and unblock it.
4. In SpaceEngineer's launch parameters, add `-plugin "path/to/the/dll"`

Alternatively, it is in the plugins list of [Plugin Loader](https://github.com/sepluginloader/PluginLoader) too.


## Usage: 
Launch the game, load any offline world and press `Shift+F` to open the editor.

Past this you will have tooltips for everything, mentioning hotkeys and such.

There is still much to be improved so feedback and bugreports are welcome in the [Issues](https://github.com/THDigi/ParticleEditor/issues) tab.
